### **Custom Color**

- To use custom color, do like this.

```dart
Color(0xFF181818),
// or
Color.fromARGB(255, 174, 89, 89)
```

- using Flutter dev tool makes better dev experience. - this one is like Chrome dev tool

### **Container Widget**

- Container widget is like `<div/>`

```dart
Container(
	child: Padding(
		padding:
			EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 20, horizontal: 50),
		child: Text(
			'Transfer',
			style: TextStyle(
			fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, fontSize: 20),
		)),
	decoration: BoxDecoration(
		color: Colors.amber,
		borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(45)),
) // Container
```

### **Use 'const' error...**

```
Use 'const' with the constructor to improve performance.
Try adding the 'const' keyword to the constructor invocation.
```

- A constant is never modified, and its value is known before compile time.
- It is useful optimization, so dart extension show warning when you can change the value as a constant.
- like this...

```dart
// show warning : Use 'const' with the constructor to improve performance.  Try adding the 'const' keyword to the constructor invocation.
backgroundColor: Color(0xFF181818),

// no warning. clear.
backgroundColor: const Color(0xFF181818),
```

- When a value is used as a constant, it is evaluated at compile time, not at runtime.
- Therefore, the performance will be optimized.
- To enable auto fix in VS Code, `prepernce -> open settiongs.json` on vs code, and add following property :

```json
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
	"source.fixAll": true,
},
```

### **Code Actions**

![](https://i.imgur.com/0UlEjML.png)

- The cursor should be placed at the first line of the code, so the actions are visible.
- This makes it easier to wrap a widget with another widget.
- The short cut is `command+.` (in mac os)

### **Reusable Widgets**

- A constant value is evaluated at compile-time. If a widget refers to a value that can change later, it can no longer be considered as a `const` value.
- in dart, file names should follow the `lower_case_with_underscore` convention.
- So, the file name should be `button.dart`
- And the code action also provide `Extract as a widget` function.

### **Stateful / Stateless Widget**

- What is the State?
- It refers to any data or information that can change during the lifetime of a widget.
- It represents the current values or conditions that affect the appearance and behavior of the UI.
  **StatelessWidget**
- Does not have state, that means the UI will not gonna change after it is built.
  **StatefulWidget**
- Can hold state, allowing the UI to update dynamically based on changes in that state.

### **Transform**

- It functions similarly to the CSS `transform` property
- modify its child widgets through scaling, rotating, translating, and more.
- In Flutter, everything is a class.
- To modify the appearance of the UI, you can look for the appropriate class or property that handles the change.
